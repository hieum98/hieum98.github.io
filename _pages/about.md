Hi I'm a C.S Ph.D. student at University of Oregon under the supervision of Professor [Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/). Before joining UO, I was an AI Resident at [VinAI](https://www.vinai.io/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. Degree in Computer Science at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/).

My research focuses on advancing the fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and Information Extraction (IE), with an emphasis on developing efficient and robust techniques for processing huge and diverse textual data. I am particularly interested in enhancing cross-lingual and cross-genre IR capabilities, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve retrieval performance across multiple languages and text types. Additionally, I am exploring innovative IE methods for extracting structured information from document-level texts. Through my work, my goal is to contribute to the development of scalable, multilingual, and versatile systems that can facilitate deeper insights and more effective knowledge discovery from vast and varied textual corpora.
